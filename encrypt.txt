PART 1:-
1.	a. By using public-private keypair for encryption and decryption, Bob & Alice can be confident that the data is what the they meant it to say.
	   The recipient is assured of the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data.
	b. The public key is used to encrpyt & a private key is used to decrypt data.
	   If Bob wants to send Alice a message, he can take Alice's public key & encrypt the message using the public key.
	   Only Alice can decrypt the encrypted message from Bob as only she has the private key for the encrypted message.
	   Therefore, Both Bob & Alice have a copy of the public key & they should not share the private key.

2. Command to generate CSR file on the Host machine.
	openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out sxp3156.csr
   		Country = US
		State = Texas
		Locality = Arlington
		Org Name = UTA
		Org Unit = iSec
		Common Name = sxp3156

3. Send sxp3156.csr to GTA.
   GTA sends back the certificate file sxp3156.crt

4. Command to generate pubkey.pem
	openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in TA_Cert.pem > pubkey.pem
   Compare pubkey.pem with TA_Key1.pub,TA_Key2.pub & TA_Key3.pub
	diff pubkey.pem TA_Key1.pub
	diff pubkey.pem TA_Key2.pub
	diff pubkey.pem TA_Key3.pub
   TA_Key3.pub is the correct public key.

PART 2:-
5. Alice certificate sent to Bob.

6. Copy Alice certificate from Download folder to lab1 folder.
	scp Download/alice.crt lab1

7. Command to Verify CA's signature on Alice certiificate.
	openssl verify -CAfile TA_Cert.pem alice.crt
   	- alice.crt: OK

8. Command to extract Alice's public key from her certificate.
	openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in alice.crt  > alice.pub 

9. Create a symmetric key & save it as symkey.bin
	openssl rand 128 > symkey.bin

10. Encrypt symkey.bin & saving it as symkey.bin.enc
	openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey alice.pub -pubin -in symkey.bin -out symkey.bin.enc

11. Send symkey.bin.enc to Alice.

12. Copy symkey.bin.enc from Download folder to lab1 folder.
	scp Download/symkey.bin.enc lab1

13. Decrypt symkey.bin.enc using Alice private key & Save file as symkey.bin
	openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey alice.key -in symkey.bin.enc -out symkey.bin 

14. 	a. Bob should use AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) as it replaces DES & Triple-DES.
	   AES also strengthens the security as well as boost its efficiency.
    	b. AES provides Key Expansion and AddRoundKey, SubBytes, ShiftRows & MixColumns.
	   There is never a 100% assurance but AES is secure & efficient enough.

15. Encrypt secret.txt & Save it as secret.txt.enc
	openssl enc -e -aes128 -in secret.txt -out secret.txt.enc -k symkey.bin

16. Send secret.txt.enc to Alice.

17. Copy secret.txt.enc from Download folder to lab1 folder.
	scp Download/secret.txt.enc lab1

18. Decrypt Bob's encrypted message & save as secret.txt
	openssl enc -d -aes128 -in secret.txt.enc -out secret.txt -k symkey.bin

19. Create a SHA-512 digest of message.txt using alice.key & saving it as message.txt.sha512
	openssl dgst -sha512 -sign alice.key -out message.txt.sha512 message.txt

20. Send message.txt & message.txt.sha512 to Bob.

21. Copy message.txt & message.txt.sha512 from Download folder to lab1 folder.
	scp -r Download lab1
		OR
	scp Download/message.txt lab1
	scp Download/message.txt.sha512 lab1

22. Verify Alice's signed message with alice.pub
	openssl dgst -sha512 -verify alice.pub -signature message.txt.sha512 message.txt
	Verified OK

23. If Alice used her public key to sign the message then anyone with Alice's public key can pretend to be Alice & forge her signatures.

24. Delete files from Alice's & Bob's machine.
	rm alice.pub symkey.bin symkey.bin.enc secret.txt secret.txt.enc message.txt message.txt.sha512
